  "description": "Ordinal Women Punks is a project that involves creating non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Bitcoin blockchain that feature illustrations of women with unique personalities and traits. Each NFT represents a distinct character and is designed to be both collectible and a form of self-expression.                        The project aims to celebrate the diversity and individuality of women, as well as promote the use of Bitcoin and blockchain technology in the art world. The Ordinal Women Punks project is inspired by the popular CryptoPunks NFT project, which features 10,000 unique pixelated characters. However, while CryptoPunks are all male, the Ordinal Women Punks project focuses exclusively on female characters.            ",
