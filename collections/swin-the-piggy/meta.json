   "description":"These compositions of the lighthearted avatar \"Swin the piggy\" were handcrafted by austrian art therapist Rosi Ringel.\nBorn end of the 1950's, they are one of the few artists of their generation to partake in the transformation of blockchain art in an intergenerational dialogue.\nAll funds raised will benefit Mrs. Ringels cancer therapy and palliative end-of-life care.\nThere is no further roadmap to this project.\nPurpose is the art that is on display, which now will forever live on Bitcoin.",
