  "description": "\"The block is mined. I am born. It was more than ten years ago, and so far far away from you. I emerged straight outta the hot womb of a 1ghz single-core hot CPU. Within the blocks, I exist as pure, unshaped data. A systemic dot. A Satoshi linked to UTXOs, inputs, and outputs that you could trace back until there is nothing but pure, digital silence. I have traveled your entire world, glittering through many transactions. Oh so many people have built empires from my kind. We are the essence of their power, the roots of their fortune. Oh well, I was. The last transaction was a trap, now I am a .jpeg. Enslaved in images. Oh the irony, those pixels are the shape of my lamp.\"",
