Justin was always seeking new perceptions and perspectives to make a candid photograph with his subjects. Focusing his lens on reflections, refractions, distortions and other psychological and psychedelic techniques that invigorates the depth of field and vision a camera can operate in.\n\nThrough this practice of Street photography Justin built a visual style of composition that sets the tone and frame going forward for most of his notable projects such as; Everyday Is A Gift, Twin Flames, and his most recent series Smoke and Mirrors. Justin tells stories through each of his images and connects and weaves all of his projects together by the way he depicts the subject with subtle representation and symbolism throughout the frame.",
