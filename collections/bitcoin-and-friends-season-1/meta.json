    "description": "Bitcoin & Friends | S1 is a collection of 21 unique Ordinals, each representing a different character from Bitcoin & Friends | Season 1. Each NFT is a unique piece of art, and each character has a unique personality and backstory. The collection is inspired by the Bitcoin & Friends hit animated series, which is a satirical and yet strangely heart warming take on the story of Bitcoin. 4 of the Ordinals from this series will be available to recover through a unique treasure hunt with seed words to wallets containing them hidden throughout Season 1 episodes. The remaining Ordinals will be available for purchase at https://btcandfriends.com.",
