  "description": "ORDINAL CLOCKS are time-aware art pieces that change their color scheme with the time of day, and show an accurate to-the-second time display of the user's given timezone.  Each piece is an SVG with embedded Javascript to create a unique wavy stylistic appearance via a custom randomization algorithm.",
